<h1>Machine Learning + Data Visualization Product</h1>

<h2>High-level Overview</h2>
<p></p><b>Problem*</b>
<br>
As you are aware, Smith Pharmaceutical, Inc.’s (SPI; a fictional company for the purpose of this project) sales largely depend on ensuring that our customers (doctors and hospitals) feel confident prescribing our products to their patients. However, 
as we have frequently heard from our customers, the abundance of different anxiety-based prescription drugs (ABPD) that are recommended based on various patient health data can be overwhelming for 
doctors to make decisions on selecting the correct drug to prescribe, consequently undermining their confidence in their choice. Our customers, and likely other customers in the future, need better 
tools to assist them in making these decisions. Currently, there is no “tool” that exists within the medical profession that helps a doctor make such a decision regarding ABPD prescription; rather, 
the prescription is solely based on a doctor’s knowledge of each ABPD.  Nonetheless, there is a clear need to have some sort of tool that helps doctors predict an appropriate ABPD to patients.<br><br>

<b>Solution/Application Benefits*</b><br>
We can service our customer’s needs through the implementation of a new data product (i.e., the “Product”). The Product will be a supervised machine learning classification model that utilizes 
a collection of customer databases on successful ABPD prescriptions. The data will be used to “train” the machine learning model so that the Product can ultimately associate various patient health 
information to the successful ABPD selection. Once the Product is “trained”, the Product will be able to predict an appropriate ABPD based on a set of patient health input values provided by a doctor. 
The Product will also be capable of showing different relationships between patient health information via graphical representations and statistical analyses. 
Said information in the Product will be displayed in a dashboard-like format.
